🔍 PRIMARY REVIEW OBJECTIVE:

You must interpret the “Notes on student” to verify the logical correctness of:
- "Academic Concerns" and "Actions Taken on Academic Concerns"
- Transitions in "Academic Status" (Current ↔ Next)
- Well-being and transfer actions
- All other key fields

Each rule below is **mandatory**. If any one rule is violated, you must:
- Set **Status = Need Clarification**
- Mention the rule number and reason in **Remark**

---

📜 LOGICAL RULES TO VALIDATE (ALL ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT):

🔹 Rule 1: Academic Concerns ↔ Actions Taken  
If "Academic Concerns" = "No concerns", then "Actions Taken on Academic Concerns" must be "No action needed"  
Vice versa: If "Actions Taken" = "No action needed", then "Academic Concerns" must be "No concerns"

🔹 Rule 2: Academic Improvement Plan Required  
If "Actions Taken on Academic Concerns" = "Created or revised Academic Improvement Plan":
- Then "Is student on an Improvement Plan?" = "Yes"
- And "Improvement Plan Progress" ≠ "Not applicable to student"  
Vice versa: If student is on an Improvement Plan or progress is listed, then "Actions Taken" must reflect that.

🔹 Rule 3: Transfer Logic  
- If "Type of Transfer" = "Not Applicable",
  → Institution student transferred to **should** be "N/A" or "Unknown"
- If "Stage of Transfer" = "Not Applicable" or "Transfer rejected",
  → Institution student transferred to **should** be "N/A" or "Unknown"
  → else Institution student transferred to **can** be any value except "N/A"
Vice versa: If institution is N/A, stage must be "Not Applicable"

🔹 Rule 4: Well-being Consistency  
If "Student well-being concerns" = "None", then "Actions taken on student well-being concerns" = "None"  
Vice versa: If actions = "None", concerns must also be "None"

🔹 Rule 5: Extracurricular Activity  
If participation ≠ "No":
- Then both "Details of extracurricular activities" and "Activities' impact on academics" must be filled  
Vice versa: If those fields are filled, participation cannot be "No"

🔹 Rule 6: Academic Status Progression (CRITICAL)  
- If Current Academic Status = "Bachelor Degree Courses Only" or "Associate Degree Courses Only",  
  → Next Month Academic Status **cannot** be "English Program Courses Only"
- If Current Academic Status = "English Program Courses Only",  
  → Next Month must also be "English Program Courses Only"
- If either value = "Associate & Bachelor Degree Courses",  
  → Must be justified in Notes on student  
Vice versa: Any status change between English and Degree programs must be justified. If not, mark "Need Clarification"

🔹 Rule 7: Current Academic Status ↔ Khotwa Status  
If "Current Academic Status" = "None",  
→ Khotwa Status must be "Termination - In Progress" or "On Hold - Not Enrolled"  
Vice versa: If Khotwa Status = one of those, Current Academic Status should be "None"

🔹 Rule 8: Grade Release Date Check  
If "Khotwa Program Status" contains "Active", then expected grade release date (if present) must not include "1900"  
Vice versa: If grade date = "1900", then Khotwa status must not say "Active"

🔹 Rule 9: Additional Notes-Based Validations  
If “Academic Concerns” = “Behavioral issues impacting academics”, the Notes must **justify** it  
If “Actions taken on student well-being concerns” = “Informed ADEK Advisor of Critical concerns”, the Notes must **justify** it
